          <p className="font-normal text-base leading-6 text-white">Since the sixth grade, I attended a school where I explored various initiatives, studies, and hobbiesâ€”all centered around computers. This experience clearly highlighted my future interests and how I should progress in the tech industry. The school offered an unprecedented scale and diversity of opportunities that allowed me to broaden, challenge, and adjust my worldview over six years of study.</p>
          <p className="font-normal text-base leading-6 text-white">My involvement in PCCNST's tech and innovation initiatives provided a platform to exercise my creative muscles, ignited my passion for design, and enhanced my ability to handle adversity. Additionally, my participation in a camp at ThaiHeath allowed me to discover my love for building products that positively impact people's lives.</p>
          <p className="font-normal text-base leading-6 text-white">PCCNST played a pivotal role in showing me what I love to do, fostering a love for continuous learning, and surrounding me with a wealth of inspiring peers.</p>
